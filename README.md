# Data Analysis with Bootstrap-coupled ESTimation (DABEST)

<p> Data Analysis with Bootstrap-coupled ESTimation (DABEST) was developed by Ho <em>et al</em>. (2019) <em>Nature Methods</em> (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/377978v2.full">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/377978v2.full</a> see <a target="_blank" href="https://rdcu.be/bHhJ4">full-text here</a>).</p>

<p> DABEST creates an <em>estimation plot</em>, aka a "Gardner–Altman plot", which shows the distribution of mean differences (or effect sizes) between conditions. A "Gardner–Altman plot" presents all data points as a swarm plot and the mean difference(s), or effect size(s), as a bootstrap 95% confidence interval.</p>

<p> See the manual for using DABEST in R at <a target="_blank" href="https://acclab.github.io/dabestr/">https://acclab.github.io/dabestr/</a>.</p>

<p> This repository contains code for DABEST analyses in R and Python using examples provided by Ho <em>et al</em>. (2019) and examples I've created using simulated data.</p>
