# Data Analysis with Bootstrap-coupled ESTimation (DABEST)

<p>Data Analysis with Bootstrap-coupled ESTimation (DABEST) was developed by Ho <em>et al</em>. (2019) <em>Nature Methods</em> (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/377978v2.full">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/377978v2.full</a> see <a target="_blank" href="https://rdcu.be/bHhJ4">full-text here</a>).</p>

<p> See manual at <a target="_blank" href="https://acclab.github.io/DABEST-python/">https://acclab.github.io/DABEST-python/</a>.</p>

<p>See the Python code on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ACCLAB/DABEST-python">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The outcome of DABEST is an <em>estimation plot</em>, aka a "Gardnerâ€“Altman plot", which shows the distribution of effect sizes. An estimation plot has two key features:</p>
<ul>
<li>It presents all datapoints as a swarmplot, which orders each point to display the underlying distribution.
<li>It presents the effect size as a bootstrap 95% confidence interval on a separate but aligned axes.
</ul>

<p>This repository contain code for DABEST analyses in R and Python using examples provided by Ho <em>et al</em>. (2019) and examples I've created using simulated data.</p>
